# Student Management System in C++

A basic student information management system built with C++ that allows you to add and view student records using file handling.

## Features

- Add student name, ID, and grade
- Save data to a text file (`students.txt`)
- View all stored student records
- Uses structures, file I/O, and basic input validation

## Technologies Used

- C++ (Standard I/O and file handling)
- Console-based interface
- Text file storage (using `ofstream` and `ifstream`)

## How to Run

1. Open the `.cpp` file in any C++ IDE or compile using:
   ```bash
   g++ student_manager.cpp -o student_manager
   ./student_manager
